# Music Recommendation System

The Music Recommendation System is a Python-based application designed to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their preferences. Leveraging the Spotify Million Song Dataset, this system incorporates content-based filtering techniques to analyze song lyrics and recommend similar tracks.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Utilizes song lyrics and TF-IDF vectorization to generate recommendations based on the similarity between songs.
- **Flask Web Interface:** Presents recommendations through a user-friendly web interface powered by Flask.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the desire to create a personalized music discovery experience for users. By harnessing the rich dataset provided by Spotify Million Song Dataset, the system aims to deliver accurate recommendations tailored to individual tastes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the recommendation system.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to build the user interface and serve recommendations to users.
- **Spotify Million Song Dataset:** A comprehensive dataset containing a million songs, including metadata and song features, utilized for training and evaluation.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:** Libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and scikit-learn used for text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and similarity calculations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Various machine learning algorithms are employed for recommendation, including cosine similarity for content-based filtering.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Front-end technologies used to design and style the web interface for an intuitive user experience.
- **Git/GitHub:** Version control system and collaboration platform used for managing project code and facilitating contributions from the community.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Music Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Flask application using the command `python app.py`.

## Usage

Upon accessing the web interface, users can input their favorite songs or artists to receive personalized recommendations. The system analyzes the provided input and generates a list of recommended tracks based on content similarity.
